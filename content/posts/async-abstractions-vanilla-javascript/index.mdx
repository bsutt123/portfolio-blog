"Theres a library for that"

We have all heard it. I often find myself reaching for a library to solve my
problem as soon as I run into my first hurdle. But I think its worth exploring
what happens when trying to develop your own abstractions. Even if you
eventually solve your problem with a library, getting additional context and
experience before you dive into library code is always a good thing

This is my time spent exploring two abstractions: an interruptable request and a
cancellable request.

### Basis

Lets say you have an async function that will make a request for you and return
the JSON results.

```javascript
const makeRequest = async (url, params) => {
  var fullUrl = url+paramterize(params);
  var newRequest = new Request(fullUrl);
  var response = await fetch(newRequest);
  var result = await response.json();
  return result;
}
```

But suppose we don't just want to make a single request. What if I wanted to be
able to make a request, and then interrupt it later?

### First Example: Interruptible Request

Calls to a server for information is one of the slowest things that happen on a
website. Lets say your app makes lots of requests to a server for information,
but only really cares about the latest request. When another request comes in,
you would like to be able to cancel the old request and kick off the new one.

Lets start with a generator function that will return our "requester"

```javascript
const interruptibleRequestGen = () => {
  let currentRequest = null;
  const controller = new AbortController();
  const signal = controller.signal;
}
```

The `AbortController` is not fully supported by all browsers, but in this case
we will use it for the purposes of exploring how we could approach cancelling
these `Promises`
[here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/AbortController/abort).

Lets flush out the rest of the implementation.

```javascript
const interruptibleRequestGen = () => {
  let currentRequest = null;
  const controller = new AbortController();
  const signal = controller.signal;
  return async function makeRequest(url, params) {
    if (currentRequest) {
      controller.abort();
    }

    const fullUrl = url + paramterize(params);
    currentRequest = new Request(fullUrl, { signal });
    const response = await fetch(currentRequest);
    const result = await response.json();

    currentRequest = null;
    return result;
  }
}
```

This generator wraps `makeRequest` function up with a closure containing
our `AbortController`. Additional requests will be aborted if they are ongoing
when another request comes in. We can invoke th

```javascript
const get_one = interruptibleRequestGen();
const get_two = interruptibleRequestGen();
const get_three = interruptibleRequestGen();

get_one("http://google.com", {}).then((result) => console.log(result))
get_one("http://facebook.com", { name: "Brady" }).then((result) => console.log(result))
get_two("https://nodejs.org", { version: "latest" }).then((result) => console.log(result))
get_three("http:/bradymackey.com", {}).then((result) => console.log(result))
```

In this example, three different "interruptible" requesters are created. The
first request `get_one` will be interrupted when the second comes in. `get_two`
and `get_three` are different functions, so they a will finish without
interrupting each other or `get_one`.

### Controlled Request

Lets say you are building an infinite loading list. As the user scrolls to the
bottom of the page, you detect they are close to the bottom and load more items.

The issue is that as the user scolls to the bottom, they might be scrolling
_fast_. Depending on how you set up your event handlers, that function might try
to execute many times, and if the results are appended to the DOM each time you
have a serious bug.

Lets approach our request from the opposite direction. Instead of cancelling our
old request when a new one comes in, lets _ignore_ later requests until our
first one finishes.

Start with another request generator function.

```javascript
function controlledRequestGen(url) {
  let allowRequests = true;
}
```

This wraps two variables in our function closure: `url` and `allowRequests`. We
can make a simple implementation of this to get started.

```javascript
function controlledRequestGen(url) {
  let allowRequests = true;

  return async (params) => {
    if (allowRequests) {
      allowRequests = false;
      const fullUrl = url + paramterize(params);
      const request = new Request(fullUrl);
      const response = await fetch(request);
      const result = await response.json();

      allowRequests = true
      return result;
    } else {
      return false;
    }
  }
}

const getFromDatabase = controlledRequestGen("http://my.api.server/db")

window.addEventListener('scroll', e => {
  if (e.scrollY > 100) {
    getFromDatabase({ page: page + 1 }).then(appendToDom)
  }
})
```

Our function will request another page the first time that the scroll event
fires. Subsequent requests are ignored until the first one has finished.

Lets assume that not only do we not want to make a request if another is
happening, but also until the user has finished some other operation. Maybe not
only do we have to wait for the request to finish, but maybe the code needs to
finish appending our results to the DOM. We can also give our users some
functionality to "allow" requests to happen again.

```javascript
function controlledRequestGen() {
  let allowRequests = true;
  const makeRequest = async (url, params) => {
    if (allowRequests) {
      allowRequests = false;
      const fullUrl = url + paramterize(params);
      const request = new Request(fullUrl);
      const response = await fetch(request);
      const result = response.json();

      return result,
    } else {
      return false;
    }
  }

  return {
    requester: makeRequest
    allowMoreRequests: () => {
      allowRequests = true
    }
  }
}

const { requester: getFromDatabase, allowMoreRequests } = controlledRequestGen("http://my.api.server/db")

window.addEventListener('scroll', e => {
  if (e.scrollY > 100) {
    const promise = getFromDatabase({ page: page + 1 })
    .then(appendToDom)
    .then(allowMoreRequests)
  }
})

```

When we finished appending to the DOM, we let the original requesting function
its ok to accept more events and get more items from the database. For 99% of
our use cases, this is all we need. There is a slight catch though. We have
given our users the ability to override and allow requests even if the first
hasn't finished. With great power comes great responsibility

### Wrapping up

These two functions are just examples of how thinking at a higher level of what
we want to do can help create a simpler, more declarative code base. The
details of these functions may be more complicated than a simple `fetch`, but
the people using them have less to worry about. Trying to wrap up bits of
functionality into separate, composable pieces is one of the best ways that I
have found to write great code.
