When I first started learning React, I was always confused that for some reason
React didn't understand that I had to use `this` everywhere. I had to bind
`this` when I called a function, or used `this.state`, `this.props`,
`this.handleClick`; you name it, you had to consider `this` and what it meant
in the context of whatever you did.

At first, I thought this was because React was poorly designed. In reality, its
a function of the way that JavaScript implements classes. For React to diverge
would be both a ton of work, and remove flexibility from the framework. This my
attempt at explaining how I understand `this`, but hopefully with the context
of how to use it within React.

### Preface: Don't just read this post

I stand on the shoulders of giants in terms of my understanding of javascript,
scope, and `this`. I highly recommend that in addition to playing with these
concepts yourselves in REPLs and your code base, explore the learning options
out there. I personally have learned a lot of this material on [Frontend
Masters](https://frontendmasters.com/) with a particular shoutout for [Kyle
Simpson](https://github.com/getify) and [Will
Sentance](http://willsentance.com/) for making absolutely phenomenal courses
that were not only fun to watch and participate in but were immensely helpful
in solidifying foundation knowledge of javascript.

### Why does `this` exist in the first place?

Before you can under `this` in React, you have to understand what `this` is in
vanilla JavaScript

Javascript variables are static or "lexically" scoped. When javascript gets
compiled, it bases what variables a block of code has access to based on where
it is defined in the code. Lexical is another word for "written", so it matters
where a variable is defined.

In a function, you don't just have access to variables in your functions local
scope, you also have access to variables up the "lexical scope chain". If you
define a function `fn2` within a function `fn1`, then `fn2` will be able to use
any variable defined in it own local variable environment _and_ anything in
`fn1`'s environment.

```javascript title:function lexical scope
function fn1() {
  var foo = 'foo';
  var bar = 'bar';
  function fn2() {
   var bar = 'bar';
   var bam = 'bam';
  }
}
```

In this contrived example, `fn2` would be able to access all four variables at
run time, but `fn1` would only be able to access `foo` and `bar`. `fn2` resides
within `fn1` so it can see variables up the chain, but `fn1` can't look for
variables down the chain.

What if I don't know what the variable will have at compile time? Maybe you
want to write a method that will reference data on an object the method is
defined on. In this case you need to _dynamically_ determine the scope at
execution time, and for that, you are going to need `this`.

### What is 'this'

Even MDN doesn't provide a great definition for what `this` is. It is hard to
boil down to a single defition, and there are always caveats. This is my best
attempt at defining what `this` is...

> `this` in javascript will by default reference the object which invoked the
> function

That doesn't sound so hard, except when you consider that sometimes you can use
`bind` to make it bound to a new function, you can use arrow functions that
won't define their own this context, you can use `call` or `apply` to change
how `this` interacts with your code. Ultimately, it can be quite tricky to
figure out what `this` actually is.

### How do I use 'this'

The simplest way to use `this` is to reference some kind of property on an
object inside a of `function` defined on that object. Lets consider the an
example Student named Brady...

```javascript
var Brady = {
  name: 'Brady',
  grades: ['A','B',...],
  changeName: function(newName) {
    this.name = newName;
  },
}
```

In this example, our `changeName` property is a function that changes the name of the Student object to be a new name.

```javascript
console.log(Brady.name); //Brady
Brady.changeName("Bill");
console.log(Brady.name); //Bill
```

Great! I have a Brady `Object` and I can change the name on the object. This
implementation means I need to manually create the all my students. Lets work
towards a function that can create students

### How does this all relate to classes

JavaScript is a prototypal language. Being a prototypal language means a lot of
things, but one of the major consequences is that JavaScript did not originally
have an implementation of Classes or Inheritance. But you could make something
that looked very much like a class using the objects and function. Lets see how
we might make a Student.

```javascript
var studentFunctions = {
  changeName: function(newName) {
    this.name = newName;
  },
}

function studentCreator(name, grades) {
  var newStudent = Object.create(studentFunctions);
  newStudent.name = name;
  newStudent.grades = grades;
  return newStudent;
}

var brady = studentCreator('Brady', ['A','B']);
var bill = studentCreator('Bill', []);

```

We have defined a function that "creates" students. It attaches the functions
we want on every student to a new `Object` with `Object.create`. It then
attaches the properties that will define that particular student from the
arguments to the creator function, and then returns the newly created student.

You probably won't see classes written like this in JavaScript. This is
definitely a lot of code, but what is happening is obvious. When you call
`studentCreator`, you are making a new object with the properties of
`studentFunctions`, assigning the inputs to properties on that object, and then
returning it. But developers are by nature lazy, so they wanted to automate
this. To streamline this process, you can use the `new` keyword. `new` will do
4 things.

1. Create a brand new `Object`
2. Create a link between that new `Object`'s prototype and the prototype of the function that called it
3. Execute the function and pass the newly created `Object` into the function as the `this` context
4. If the function doesn't return anything, returns `this` from the function

That lets you take our above code and make it into something that looks like this...

```javascript
function Student(name, grades) {
  this.name = name;
  this.grades = grades;
}

Student.prototype.changeName = function(newName) {
  this.name = newName;
}

var brady = new Student('Brady',['A','B'])
var bill = new Student('Bill', [])

```

This is fewer lines of code and is much more declaritive. But if you don't
understand whats happening under the hood, then the behavior you get might feel
odd.

This is how javascript creates classes, which are defined by properties and
methods on an `Object`. When you are using `this` inside of these classes, you
are ultimately trying to reference the `this` that is that `Object`. You want to
get to the variable `state` you put on the `Object`, you have to get it with `this.state`.
You want to access the `handleChange` you defined as a property as
`this.handleChange`. And most importantly _inside_ those functions you _need_
`this` to reference that class `Object` so that you can do all the wonderful
things you want to do with your React Components

#### But I'm using classes, not Objects!

In Javascript, `class` is just syntactic sugar for using the exact same
notation that I specified above. You could also write a student class like
this.

```javascript
class Student {
  constructor(name, grades) {
    this.name = name;
    this.grades = grades;
  }

  changeName(newName) {
    this.name = newName;
  }
}

```

classes have a couple extra bits (like the `super` keyword) but for most cases,
they are the exact same thing. This syntax is easier to write, and has a ton of
advantages. But its largest disadvantage is that its very easy to create a
class in javascript and have _no_ idea how it works under the hood, which can lead
to misunderstanding and bugs down the line.

## When are you gonna talk about React already!

To understand `this` in React, you have to understand `this` in plain old
javascript.

A long time ago, React added functionality to use the native ES6 class to make
a React component. For better or for worse they chose to not [auto-bind
this](https://reactjs.org/blog/2015/01/27/react-v0.13.0-beta-1.html#autobinding),
and instead implemented classes the same as ES6 would.

So largely, it is on you to bind the right this context to your functions so
that they can access the `this` that has all the properties like `setState`,
`state`, and anything else you define on the class `Object`. If you don't, then
when you go update the state, or change anything on `this`, your function will
fail as `this` will be `undefined`.

### How to bind `this` to your functions

One of the things that I don't like about React is just how many different
ways there are to bind `this`. I think that it leads to confusion about what is
happening and where the `this` binding is actually occuring. I'm going to try
and detail all the ways that I know how to bind this, and hopefully that should
give you a good idea of how you might see it happening.

But just as important as examples are understanding the tools that are used
to bind `this`, and that means that we need to talk about regular functions,
arrow functions and the `bind` keyword...

#### Aside: Arrow Functions

ES6 made a new syntax for functions that looks like this.

```javascript
var printHey = () => console.log('hey')
```

Its called an arrow function. In this case, that arrow function is
equivalent to this function expression.

```javascript
var printHey = function() {
  return console.log('hey')
}
```

So whats the difference? That can be illustrated with another object.

```javascript
this.name = "Bill"

myCoolObject = {
  name: "Brady",
  printArrow: () => {
    console.log(this.name)
  },
  printReg() {
    console.log(this.name)
  }
}

myCoolObject.printArrow() //Bill
myCoolObject.printReg()  //Brady
```

It looks like these two functions do the same thing, but they actually print
different things to the console. Why?

Arrow functions don't define their own `this` context, they inherit it from the
lexical scope. Function declarations bind their `this` context from the object
that they are defined on. So `printReg` gets `this.name` from `myCoolObject`,
but `printArrow` gets `this.name` from the environmnet where `myCoolObject` is
defined.

If a function doesn't use `this`, then there is no difference between arrow and
function declarations. But this subtle difference allows us to use arrows to
define functions in React without binding then like normal function
declarations.

### Binding this in React

Here is a brief summary of how I have seen people commonly bind this...

`this` could be bound to the function in the constructor.

```javascript
class Button extends React.Component {
  constructor() {
    ...
    this.toggle = this.toggle.bind(this);
  }

  toggle() {
  ...Some dope logic using this
  }

  render() {
    ...type up some sweet sweet JSX
    <RandomThing toggleProp={this.toggle} />
  }
}

```

Or you can define the function as an arrow function on the `class`.

```javascript
class Button extends React.Component {
  constructor() {
    ...
  }

  toggle = () => {
    ...Some dope logic using this
  }

  render() {
    ...type up some sweet sweet JSX
    <RandomThing toggleProp={this.toggle} />
  }
}
```

But which is better?

That is really up to preference. I used to prefer `bind(this)` because it was
more explicit. Today I prefer arrow functions because they are more common and
reduce noise. Each has its place. But whats more important than how you bind
`this` in your React components is understanding why you have to do it in the
first place. A deeper undersanding of lexical and relative scoping in variables
is valuable no matter what you are programming in JavaScript.

### 2020 Update

I originally wrote this article in 2018. How time flies when it comes to React.
I used to spend hours teaching students about `this` in React, and now you
don't have to worry about it at all because Functional Components are far more
common than Class Components. You probably won't need to do a lot of binding in
todays React. But much of this is about `this` in general, rather than the
specific case of React, so I hope that you can still glean some useful bits of
knowledge.
