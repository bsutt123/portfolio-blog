I'm a software developer currently living in Connecticut. I primarily work in
Javascript and Ruby, but I also enjoy learning new languages like Elixir and Go
in my free time. If you are looking for a developer whose passionate about
working on exciting problems with an awesome team, I am a perfect fit for you.

I am also a lot more than a developer. I worked for 4 years in the food
industry managing Chipotles and working as a pizza chef. I spent my summers in
college as a camp counselor leading canoeing trips. I was a dynamics engineer
as SpaceX. I am a new father and learning about the challenges of parenting
every day.

If you want to contact me about an opportunity because you think I would be a
good fit for your company, please reach out to me via email.
